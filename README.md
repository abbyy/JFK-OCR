# The JFK Files: Fully OCR'd & Searchable 
The **JFK files** are now part of the public domain, offering a trove of historical documents for researchers, journalists, and enthusiasts alike. 
However, the vast collection remains **unindexed, lacks a text layer, and is difficult to search**—making it challenging to analyze effectively, especially for AI-powered research.  
As a leader in **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology**, **ABBYY** is facilitating research. We are providing the JFK files as **fully searchable, structured PDFs**, freely available for the open-source community. By making these documents **machine-readable**, we aim to **unlock deeper insights, accelerate historical research, and enable advanced AI-driven analysis**.
